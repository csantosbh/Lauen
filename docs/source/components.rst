Components
**********

`Components <http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/component.html>`_ are
objects that can be attatched to any game object.

In LauEngine, any GameObject can have multiple instances of the same component.
The lack of restrictions requires the user to be careful when designing game
objects.
