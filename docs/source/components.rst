Components
**********

`Components <http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/component.html>`_ are
objects that can be attatched to any game object.

In LauEngine, a GameObject can have multiple instances of the same component --
which doesn't mean you should have them. The lack of restrictions requires the
user to be careful when designing game objects.
