Scripting
**********

In this documentation, the word `"scripting"` is used loosely to refer to C++
code.

LauEngine makes heavy usage of the `Eigen linear algebra
<http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/>`_ library, and many functions and fields are
based on types defined in that library. If you are not familiar to Eigen, make
sure to have its documentation at hand.
